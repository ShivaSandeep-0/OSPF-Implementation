# OSPF-Implementation

## Router Simulation Program

### Description

The router simulation program allows users to create a network of routers and analyze routing tables to find the shortest path between routers using Dijkstra's algorithm.

### Prerequisites

- C++ compiler supporting C++11 standard or later

### How to Run

1. Clone the repository or download the source code files.
2. Compile the source code using a C++ compiler.
3. Run the compiled executable.

### Usage

Upon running the program, users are presented with a menu to perform various actions:

- **Create Router and Add Neighbors**: Create routers and specify incoming and outgoing neighbors.
- **Find Path**: Find the shortest path between two routers.
- **Print Routing Tables**: Display routing tables of all routers in the network.
- **Delete Router**: Delete a router from the network.
- **Exit**: Exit the program.

Follow the on-screen instructions to perform desired actions.
